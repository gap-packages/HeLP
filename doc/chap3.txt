  [33X[0;0YA  short  remark  is  probably  in  order  on the three global variables the
  package  is using: [9XHeLP_CT[109X, [9XHeLP_sol[109X and [9XHeLP_settings[109X. The first one stores
  the  character  table  for  which  the last calculations were performed, the
  second  one  containing  at  the  [9Xk[109X's spot the already calculated admissible
  partial augmentations of elements of order [23Xk[123X (and its powers [23Xu^d[123X for [23Xd \not=
  k[123X  a  divisor  of  [23Xk[123X).  If  a  function of the HeLP-package is called with a
  character  table  different  from  the one saved in [9XHeLP_CT[109X then the package
  tries to check if the character tables belong to the same group. This can be
  done  in  particular  for tables from the ATLAS. If this check is successful
  the  solutions already written in [9XHeLP_sol[109X are kept, otherwise this variable
  is   reset.   For  a  more  detailed  account  see  Sections  [14X4.2[114X,  [14X5.2[114X  and
  [2XHeLP_ChangeCharKeepSols[102X  ([14X3.4-1[114X). In most situations, the user does not have
  to  worry  about  this, the program will take care of it as far as possible.
  [9XHeLP_settings[109X  is  a  varaible  which  is used to store some settings of the
  program.[133X

  linear  inequalities  and  redund  from  lrslib  to simplify the inequlities
  before handing them over to the solver (HeLP can also be used without lrslib
  installed. In general it is recommanded to have lrslib installed, if 4ti2 is
  used  as  the  solver). The following functions can be used to influence the
  behaviour of these external programms.[133X

  one  of  the  stings  "4ti2"  or "normaliz", then the solver used for future

  are  [9X"32"[109X, [9X"64"[109X and [9X"gmp"[109X. After calling the function the new precision will
  be  used  until  this  function  is used again. The default value is [9X"32"[109X. A
  higher precision causes slower calculations. But this function might be used
  to  increase  the  precision  of  4ti2,  when one gets an error message like
  "Error,  4ti2  Error:  Results  were  near maximum precision (32bit). Please
  restart  with  higher precision!" stating that the results were close to the
