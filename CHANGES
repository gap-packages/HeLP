Changes v3.4 -> v3.5

* Package now dependend on AtlasRep to avoid undeclared variable

Changes v3.3 -> v3.4

* Package migrated to GitHub


Changes v3.2 -> v3.3

* testfile in PackageInfo.g changed to "tst/testall.g"


Changes v3.1 -> v3.2

* Solely line 542 in "expamples/examples.g" corrected


Changes v3.0 -> v3.1

* New function HeLP_AutomorphismOrbits

* New function HeLP_IsZCKnown

* New functions HeLP_WithGivenOrderAllTables and HeLP_WithGivenOrderAndPAAllTables

* New functions HeLP_WriteTrivialSolution


Changes v2.2 -> v3.0

* Normaliz is included as a possible solver. 

* Functions included to switch between the solvers. For normaliz a function is included, to influence whether normaliz computes vertices of polyhedra.


Changes v2.1 -> v2.2

* Package can be loaded even if zsolve was not found.  An error is indicated explaining the situation when a function is called that needs zsolve but zsolve was not found when loading the package.

* The functions HeLP_WithGivenOrderSConstant and HeLP_VerifySolution give more output in InfoLevel 1 or higher on the number of solutions


Changes v2.0 -> v2.1

* HeLP_WithGivenOrder always returns a value (in the case there are infinitely many solutions, the function returns "infinite", in case the function can't be applied -- the characteristic of the Brauer table divides the order or s-constant characters can't be used -- the function returns "non-admissible")

* Functionality of the Wagner-Test essentialy improved.

* New function "HeLP_WithGivenOrderAndPAAndSpecificSystem"
 


Changes v1.0 -> v2.0

* The package now provides an interface to redund from the lrslib software to remove redundant inequalities before solving the system obtained by the HeLP-method.

* There is a new global variable HeLP_settings determining whether 'redund' will be used or not to get rid of redundant equations before using 4ti2.  The variable has true as default value, whenever the executable redund is found by GAP, false otherwise (so that the package can still be used without lrslib being installed).  It also stores the precision with which 4ti2 will be called.  Here, the default value is "32".  The value of HeLP_settings can be influenced by the new functions HeLP_UseRedund and HeLP_Change4ti2Precision.

* HeLP_ZC and HeLP_PQ do not use solutions, which were previously calculated for the group or character table in question, but start all calculations from scratch.

* Bug in HeLP_VerifySolution and related functions fixed (when checking for elements of order k the global factor 1/k was missing)

* New function 'HeLP_PossiblePartialAugmentationsOfPowers' to calculate the possibel partial augmentations for the powers



TODO:
* (s,t)-constant characters.
